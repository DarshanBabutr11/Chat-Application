Project Description: Secure Chat Room Application
Overview:
The project is a Secure Chat Room Application that allows multiple users to communicate in real-time over a secure connection. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to ensure the privacy and security of messages exchanged between the server and clients. The system includes both a graphical client interface and a multi-threaded server capable of handling multiple simultaneous connections.

Key Features:
Secure Communication:

Uses SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure data transmission.
Includes certificate verification (server.crt) to authenticate the server to clients.
Graphical User Interface (Client):

The client interface is built using Tkinter, providing:
A text box to display chat messages.
An input field for typing messages.
A "Send" button for message submission.
Multi-Client Support:

The server is multi-threaded, enabling it to manage multiple clients concurrently.
Messages from one client are broadcasted to all other connected clients.
Real-Time Messaging:

Real-time bi-directional communication is implemented using socket programming with TCP for reliable message delivery.
Welcome Messages and Notifications:

The server sends a welcome message to new clients.
When a client connects or disconnects, the server notifies all other connected users.
Technologies Used:
Python Libraries:

socket for network communication.
ssl for adding encryption to sockets.
tkinter for creating the client-side GUI.
threading for handling concurrent tasks (e.g., managing multiple clients and handling real-time messaging).
SSL/TLS Certificates:

The server uses a certificate (server.crt) and private key (server.key) to establish a secure connection.
The client verifies the server's authenticity using the certificate.
How It Works:
Server:

Listens for incoming client connections on a specified port (8080).
Wraps sockets using SSL/TLS for secure communication.
Maintains a list of connected clients and handles:
Receiving messages from clients.
Broadcasting messages to all other clients.
Client:

Connects securely to the server using SSL/TLS.
Provides a graphical interface for users to send and receive messages.
Handles sending user messages to the server and displaying incoming messages in the chat window.
Use Cases:
Secure Communication:
Ideal for use cases requiring encrypted chat systems to protect sensitive information.
Learning Tool:
Useful for students and developers interested in understanding socket programming, SSL/TLS integration, and multi-threading in Python.
Multi-User Communication:
Acts as a foundation for building advanced chat systems, such as customer support systems or collaborative tools.
Future Enhancements:
Add user authentication (e.g., username/password login).
Implement private messaging between users.
Enhance the GUI with features like message timestamps and themes.
Deploy the server on a remote host for wider access.
This project is a great demonstration of building a secure, user-friendly, and scalable chat application!
